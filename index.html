                Literacy is popularly understood as an ability to read and write in at least one method of writing, an understanding reflected by mainstream dictionaries.In this view, illiteracy would be considered to be the inability to read and write.
                Some researchers suggest that the term “literacy” can be historically divided into the period before 1950, when literacy was understood solely as alphabetical literacy (word and letter recognition) and the period after 1950, when literacy slowly began to be considered as a wider concept and process, i.e., functional literacy (Dijanošić, 2009).[7] This widening of the traditional concept of literacy took place as consensus emerged among researchers in composition studies, education research, and anthropological linguistics that it makes little sense to speak of reading or writing.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship. Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br>Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants.Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved. Study skills, academic skill, or study strategies are approaches applied to learning. They are generally critical to success in school,considered essential for acquiring good grades, and useful for learning throughout one's life.</p>
